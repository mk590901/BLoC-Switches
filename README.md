# Event driven BLoC's switch widgets

The project contains several switch widgets built using __BLoC__ technology, allowed to minimize the scene rendering when updating the GUI.

## Introduction

Two pairs of switches have been created, based on the processing of callbacks of GestureDetector. They differ in functionality:
* first pair: FlatSwitch and FlatRoundedSwitch react to clicks and process onTap callback,
* second: FlatAdvancedSwitch and FlatAdvancedRoundedSwitch handle callbacs onTapDown and onTapUp.
