# Event driven BLoC's switch widgets

The project contains several switch widgets built using __BLoC__ technology, allowed to minimize the scene rendering when updating the GUI.

## Introduction

Two pairs of switches have been created, based on the processing of callbacks of __GestureDetector__. They differ in functionality:
* first pair: __FlatSwitch__ and __FlatRoundedSwitch__ react to clicks and process __onTap__ callback,
* second: __FlatAdvancedSwitch__ and __FlatAdvancedRoundedSwitch__ handle callbacs __onTapDown__ and __onTapUp__.
